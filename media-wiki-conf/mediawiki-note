The Main Page is the page that the wiki goes to if no page is specified in parameters to index.php. It is also the page that one is taken to if one clicks on the logo or on the Main page item on the sidebar. The title at which the main page is accessed can be modified by changing

MediaWiki:Mainpage

The term "main page" and its translations can still be accessed via the system message

MediaWiki:Mainpage-description
for use in
MediaWiki:Sidebar and so on.

To change which page is the main page, in the search bar, type "MediaWiki:Mainpage". Then edit it so its content is the name of the page you want to be the main page. "MediaWiki:Mainpage" should always contain the title, because it is a system message that is reserved for the title of the main page, so don't change it to MediaWiki:x.

The title displayed on the Main Page can be customized by editing MediaWiki:Mainpage-title and MediaWiki:Mainpage-title-loggedin. If created but set to the empty string, no title will be shown.
