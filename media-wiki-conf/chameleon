Here is the short version:

Installation with Composer
On a command line go to your MediaWiki installation directory and run these two commands

COMPOSER=composer.local.json composer require --no-update mediawiki/chameleon-skin:~4.0
composer update mediawiki/chameleon-skin --no-dev -o
Then, open LocalSettings.php in an editor, and add the following lines:

wfLoadExtension( 'Bootstrap' );
wfLoadSkin( 'chameleon' );
Optional: to set Chameleon as the default skin, find $wgDefaultSkin and amend it:

$wgDefaultSkin='chameleon';
Save the file. To verifying Chameleon was installed correctly, navigate to Special:Version on your wiki.

If you run into problems, try the troubleshooting.

Installation without Composer
Install and enable the Bootstrap extension.

Download Chameleon and place the file(s) in a directory called chameleon in your skins/ folder.

Add the following code at the bottom of your LocalSettings.php:

wfLoadSkin( 'chameleon' );
To set Chameleon as the default skin, find $wgDefaultSkin and amend it:

$wgDefaultSkin = 'chameleon';
Done: Navigate to Special:Version on your wiki to verify that the skin is successfully installed.

Update with Composer
From your MediaWiki installation directory run composer update "mediawiki/chameleon-skin" --no-dev -o

If you want to upgrade from Chameleon 2.x to 3.x, first edit composer.local.json. Change "mediawiki/chameleon-skin": "~2.0" to "mediawiki/chameleon-skin": "~3.0".

De-installation with Composer
Before de-installation make sure you secure (move, backup) any custom files you might want to retain.

Remove the Chameleon skin from the composer.local.json file. Then run composer update "mediawiki/chameleon-skin" from the MediaWiki installation directory.
